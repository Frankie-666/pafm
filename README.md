# PHP AJAX File Manager

## Installation

Open pafm.php with your code editor of choice
then scroll down till you see **/\*\* configuration \*\*/**

* PASSWORD is, obviously, the password for PAFM.

* ROOT is the path to the directory you want to
  manage.
  *  E.g. if you want to manage your home directoy,
  change ROOT to **'/home/'**. I usually set this to **'..'**,
  the directory "above" the pafm folder.
