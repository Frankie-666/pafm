Open pafm.php with your code editor of choice
then scroll down till you see /** configuration **/

Change these directives as you see fit.

PASSWORD is, obviously, the password for PAFM.

ROOT is the path to the directory you want to
manage. E.g. if you want to manage your home directoy,
change ROOT to '/home/'. I usually set this to '..',
the directory "above" the pafm folder.
